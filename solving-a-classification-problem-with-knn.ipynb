A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a \"women and children first\" protocol for loading lifeboats.\n","2. First and second class passengers were most likely to reach the lifeboats. Third class passengers had to find their way through a maze of corridors and staircases to reach the boat deck.\n","3. Many lifeboats were launched only partially loaded.\n","\n","Given the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceburg in the north Atlantic it's reasonable to expect anyone who didn't make it into a lifeboat was highly unlikely to survive due to cold exposure. Thus anyone not in a female-children-group **and** who did not get on a lifeboat before they were all launched was unlikely to survive.\n","\n","### Let's get started!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e5ded7ff","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-26T09:14:04.615032Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-26T09:14:04.613576Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.251102Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.250274Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-20T11:13:26.177603Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.680859,"end_time":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.251299","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-26T09:14:04.57044","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv\n","/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv\n","/kaggle/input/titanic/gender_submission.csv\n"]}],"source":["# Import all packages that we'll work with \n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","import warnings\n","\n","import os\n","for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","\n","# Ignore deprecation warnings from sklearn\n","warnings.filterwarnings(module='sklearn*', action='ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"49971c7c","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.32968Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.328853Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.386533Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.387206Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-20T11:13:26.191725Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.099971,"end_time":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.387409","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-12-26T09:14:06.287438","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>PassengerId</th>\n","      <th>Survived</th>\n","      <th>Pclass</th>\n","      <th>Name</th>\n","      <th>Sex</th>\n","      <th>Age</th>\n","      <th>SibSp</th>\n","      <th>Parch</th>\n","      <th>Ticket</th>\n","      <th>Fare</th>\n","      <th>Cabin</th>\n","      <th>Embarked</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Braund, Mr. Owen Harris</td>\n","      <td>male</td>\n","      <td>22.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>A/5 21171</td>\n","      <td>7.2500</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>S</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Th...</td>\n","      <td>female</td>\n","      <td>38.0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>PC 17599</td>\n","      <td>71.2833</td>\n","      <td>C85</td>\n","      <td>C</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Heikkinen, Miss.
